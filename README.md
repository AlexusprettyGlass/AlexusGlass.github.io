## Projects 
### Spotify Music Recommendation System
|https://github.com/AlexusprettyGlass/Music-Recommendation-System.git |

|In order to find key components for a recommendation system, I carried out exploratory data analysis and exhibited data visualization techniques. I used **Python's** machine learning tools, such sci-kit learn, to create algorithms that could categorize certain variables and properties to get the best suggestion. To import and arrange the substantial Spotify data sets, I also used open-source Python packages like Pandas.|  

- Checked for all the analysis with the target as 'popularity'. Used yellowbrick package to check for the Feature Correlation.
- Performed an analysis by categorizing the data by year to comprehend how the general tone of music has changed throughout time.
- Used the K-means clustering algorithm to divide the genres in the datasets by ten clusters based on the numerical audio features of each genres.
