- A.S., Computer Science | Georgia State University (_May 2022_)

## Work Experience
**Data Scientist Intern @ ABC Consultants Group**
- Contributed to the architecture and implementation of next generation data and BI solutions.  Managed AWS resources including Redshift, S3, EC2, Athena and Glue.

- Collaborated with BI Engineers, Software Engineers, and cross-functionally and delivered high quality data architecture and pipelines. 

- Created big data solutions using EMR/Elastic Search/Redshift. Built efficient and scalable data services and integrated data systems with AWS tools and services to support a variety of customer use cases and applications.

- Tested multivariate linear & non-linear regression implementations on Hadoop cluster using R, Spark, Mlib, & MATLAB. Derived actionable insights from massive data sets with minimal support. 

- Identified, designed, and implemented internal process improvements: automated manual processes, optimized data delivery, re-designed infrastructure for greater functionality and scalability.



## Projects (All Projects Located in Repository)
### Spotify Music Recommendation System

|In order to find key components for a recommendation system, I carried out exploratory data analysis and exhibited data visualization techniques. I used **Python's** machine learning tools, such sci-kit learn, to create algorithms that could categorize certain variables and properties to get the best suggestion. To import and arrange the substantial Spotify data sets, I also used open-source Python packages like Pandas.|  

- Checked for all the analysis with the target as 'popularity'. Used yellowbrick package to check for the Feature Correlation.
- Performed an analysis by categorizing the data by year to comprehend how the general tone of music has changed throughout time.
- Used the K-means clustering algorithm to divide the genres in the datasets by ten clusters based on the numerical audio features of each genres.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

|This project covers credit card fraud and is meant to look at a dataset of transactions and predict whether it is fraudulent or not. I learned alot of this from Eduonix Learning Solutions. Looking at precision for fraudulent cases lets us know the percentage of cases that they are getting correctly labeled. 'Precision' accounts for false-positives. 'Recall' accounts for false-negatives. Low numbers could mean that we are constantly calling clients asking them if they actually made the transaction which could be annoying. Our Isolation Forest method was able to produce a better result. Looking at the f1-score 26% of the time we are going to detect the fraudulent transactions.|

**Goal: To get better percentages.**

- You can see most of the V's are clustered around 0 with some or no outliers. Notice we have very few fraudulent cases over valid cases in our class histogram.
- Split the data to assure that I always get the same output and to create reproducible results
- Plotted the histogram of each parameter
- Determined the number fraud classes by creating a data class and and outlier fraction.
- Summarized the large credit card dataset by creating a correlation matrix for the different variables to how all the possible pairs of values in the table are related.
